# Warning!
Mess with these scriptable objects at your own peril. You can very easily break your game by changing these values. Please use version control and only modify these if you know what you're doing. If you're still exploring the tutorials, turn around and go back. You can come back later when you know what these are for.

Even as an advanced user, you should make changes lightly. For example, if you were to remove the `PlayerObjective` bool from `Objective`, this *will* break your game. Don't change these default properties.

One exception would be names- say you're making a game set in space and you want to change `ShallowWater` to `MoonDust`. Go ahead, that's not going to break anything :) 

As you explore more, you'll better understand this and other exceptions and how you can leverage them to make your game unique. If you aren't confident, best to leave these alone.
